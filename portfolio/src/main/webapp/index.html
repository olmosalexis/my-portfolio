      <h1>Alexis Olmos's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alexis Olmos. I'm a thoughtful, energetic, and committed student pursuing 
          a BA in Economics and Computer Science at Grinnell College. I am eager to pursue a position in 
          which I can learn and grow with a company in the finance/tech industry. Until then, I want to 
          keep learning and growing both my interpersonal and technical skills so that I can strive to be 
          the most successful version of myself.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, where I've resided all of my life up until I started attending 
          Grinnell College which is out of state in Iowa. During my free time I enjoy scouring the news to
          see what's new in the US economy and in the world. I also enjoy reading manga and watching anime
          when I'm not occupied doing work.</p>
